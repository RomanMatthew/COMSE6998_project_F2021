rotation_generator.py: A library to generate small 3D rotation matrices

The class generates a 3x3 matrix describing a rotation in 3D space, 
where each element relevant to the rotation is an angle (in radians) 
whose minimum is 0 (inclusive) and whose maximum is specified by user 
input. This is intended to create "small" rotations, ___

# TODO: research and suggest how to define a "small" angle

# Insert class here lol (I'll do it later tonight)
